## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (DESKTOP, MOBILE AND TABLET)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I furthered my knowledge of CSS GRID AND FLEXBOX with this project and I had to think outside the box of my previous knowledge and experiences building this project. I add animation to some of the elements to get a scope of how animations work.
